# The Bedroom
It seems like last night was ages ago. You were goofing around at a
bar with your friend, and you felt too queasy to stay there anymore.
You don't remember much of your drunken night out, but you vaguely
remember telling your friend to lock your high-tech front door... Too
bad you don't remember how to unlock it.

South of your full-sized bed are some double doors leading to the
office. To the east is a closet door. To the west, you see a small
nightstand with a lamp and some papers on it. As you ponder your
existence, you realize you should really get around to decorating
your pathetic little bedroom. Perhaps inspiration will strike after
a short walk around the neighborhood.

# The Closet
The poorly-lit closet seems very mundane. Some casual clothes line
the east wall, hanging on some plastic hangers. Along the north wall,
there are some shelves with various trinkets. Among those trinkets is
a scrambled Rubik's Cube. The south wall is mostly empty, apart from
eleven pairs of shoes stacked precariously on top of one another.
%5%
# Family Room
You are greeted by a mediocre television setup spanning the east half of
the room. The northeast corner is home to a u-shaped couch with a coffee
table in front. Four mini tetrominoes sit atop the table, stacked
together to look like they're from a game of Tetris. In the southeast
corner, you see a wall-mounted TV beside a large bean bag chair. To the
west, there are some bookshelves filled with seemingly random books you
bought on a whim.
%6%
# Kitchen/Dining Room
You step into the dining area which also doubles as your personal
kitchen. A window hangs above the countertop on the north side, shining
the morning light onto the dinner table. Beside the counter in the
northwest corner, you see a small penguin sitting there. Some seating
adorns the table and countertop, but you usually only need one chair.
%7%
# Spooky Hallway
Before you is an unnecessarily long hallway lit by nothing but a few
electronic candles mounted on the walls. Several pumpkins line the hall,
but you aren't sure why. It'd probably be faster to go through the
living room to reach the foyer.
%8%
# Hidden Bathroom
What. The. Heck. Why is there a hidden bathroom in my house? Who decided
this would be a good idea? It's so small--anyway, there's a key hanging
on a hook across from the toilet. The entire west wall is covered by a
counter and a sink, so you only have a 1x2 area to walk around in.
%9%
# Office
Your simplistic office fills you with peace as the radiant morning sun
beams in through the window. Near the center of the room is your desk: a
standard rectangular wooden table with a laptop, an empty mug, and a
large metal slinky. Some cabinets line the south wall, but you've never
actually used them. The northeast corner houses a gray filing cabinet
and a math poster.

The rest of your house is locked behind the east door. All you remember
is that it has a 10-digit combination lock.
%10%
# Laundry Room
You look around the laundry room. It's nothing to write home about.
There is a washing machine and a dryer pushed up against the south wall,
both of which are currently off. Along the west wall is a couple of
shelves with various cleaners and detergents. In the northeast corner, a
comically large laundry basket sits there, reeking of sweat and wet
grass. You silently promise to do the laundry as soon as you come back
from that walk.
%11%
# Living Room
The living room feels mildly melancholic. A fragmented ring of couches
circle the room, leaving room for the two entrances and a small table in
the northeast corner of the room. In the center of the room, you see a
large coffee table with three lamps placed on it. The carpet under your
feet calms your existential dread a little bit.
%12%
# Foyer
You enter an open space; it's a nice break from some other rooms in your
house. A large circular rug with a peculiar pattern occupies most of the
floor. There are two paintings in the room: one of a daisy in a vase on
the north wall, and another of a llama on the east wall. To the west is
a large archway leading to the living room. There's also a small doorway
in the northeast corner.

# Use the Rubik's Cube
You fiddle with the Rubik's Cube as the algorithms come back to you.
Your moves become nearly mindless, racing to solve the cube.

When you finish the final step, the green central tile pops out,
revealing a small strip of paper. The only thing written on it is the
letter "e". Strange.

You pocket the paper and put the Rubik's Cube away.

# Penguin's Description
-- Penguin --
A helpful little penguin you keep in your kitchen. It only responds to
your voice and will remember secrets you tell it in case you forget.
Unfortunately, the developer couldn't be bothered to let you tell it new
secrets, so you're stuck with the hard-coded ones. Sorry.

# Use the Penguin (1)
hey, in case your bladder is getting a bit full, you have a secret
bathroom in the spooky hallway. if you line yourself up vertically with
the tip of the middle wall, you can walk into the westmost wall and find
it. sorry if that's confusing, but you should find it soon enough.
