# The Bedroom
It seems like last night was ages ago. You were goofing around at a
bar with your friend, and you felt too queasy to stay there anymore.
You don't remember much of your drunken night out, but you vaguely
remember telling your friend to lock your high-tech front door... Too
bad you don't remember how to unlock it.

South of your full-sized bed are some double doors leading to the
office. To the east is a closet door. To the west, you see a small
nightstand with a lamp and some papers on it. As you ponder your
existence, you realize you should really get around to decorating
your pathetic little bedroom. Perhaps inspiration will strike after
a short walk around the neighborhood.

# The Closet
The poorly-lit closet seems very mundane. Some casual clothes line
the east wall, hanging on some plastic hangers. Along the north wall,
there are some shelves with various trinkets. Among those trinkets is
a scrambled Rubik's Cube. The south wall is mostly empty, apart from
eleven pairs of shoes stacked precariously on top of one another.

# Rubik's Cube Description
-- Rubik's Cube --
A colorful small cube composed of 27 smaller cubiods. I think I remember
how to solve it, but I haven't touched it in years.

# Use the Rubik's Cube
You fiddle with the Rubik's Cube as the algorithms come back to you.
Your moves become nearly mindless, racing to solve the cube.

When you finish the final step, the green central tile pops out,
revealing a small strip of paper. The only thing written on it is the
letter "e". Strange.

You pocket the paper and put the Rubik's Cube away.
