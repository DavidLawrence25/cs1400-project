It seems like last night was ages ago. You were goofing around at a
bar with your friend, and you felt too queasy to stay there anymore.
You don't remember much of your drunken night out, but you vaguely
remember telling your friend to lock your high-tech front door...

South of your full-sized bed are some double doors leading to the
office. To the east is a closet door. To the west, you see a small
nightstand with a lamp and some papers on it. As you ponder your
existence, you realize you should really get around to decorating
your pathetic little bedroom. Perhaps inspiration will strike after
a short walk around the neighborhood.
